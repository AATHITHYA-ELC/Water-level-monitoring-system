4.Implement multithreading for concurrent client handling.
5.Receive water level data from the Raspberry pi client.
6.Generate alarms and notifications for high water levels.
7.Program the Raspberry pi to read water level values from the sensor.
8.Establish a TCP/IP connection with the server.
9.Send water level data to the server.
10.Program the Raspberry Pi to listen for button press events.
11.Create a user interface button to control the client data and send control signals from the server to activate the buzzer.
12.Integrate with ThingSpeak to store and retrieve data.
13.Test the communication between the clients and the server.
